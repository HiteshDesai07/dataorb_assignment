40	B09DFHJTF5	R121PJU90MZG4H	Incredible, I was not prepared for how cool this is.	This is it, it’s truly next gen. After a couple of years trying, we finally got the digital version thanks to Amazon’s waitlist.  I have a high end pc and was a little dismissive of what I thought the PS5 would be capable of.

Even one of the launch games, Spider-Man Miles Morales, still looks, and more importantly fells, next gen now still.  This thing is optimized, loaded, and the combination of features working together makes it feel special. The controller is on another level. This is immersive.

61	B08H75RTZ8	R3CB7FHQ3XRIV3	Probably my favourite console so far	I got an Xbox Series S earlier and I was already very happy with it, however, I had the chance to get a series X later and I will say, the extra storage alone and disc drive makes it worth it, not even talking about the 4k visuals. Add in gamepass and you have a hell of a deal on an amazing console	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CB7FHQ3XRIV3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08H75RTZ8	5	2022-11-02T00:00:00.000Z

67	B08H75RTZ8	RAHIZ1EUIDAN3	$500 for wifi disconnection frustration	the console disconnects from wifi constantly - every 20-30 mins- end up having to reboot it all the time.  Have tried various fixes from what i scoured on the googles (seperate 2.4 and 5ghz ssid's for example). What eventually worked to have stable wifi was disabling WPA2, which i didnt like.  Ended up using an old router that was AC compatible and ethernet wired the X to the router, then bridged it to our wifi.  disappointed in the $$$ paid for this issue, which has been ongoing since its launch. simple google search will show other users with same issue.	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAHIZ1EUIDAN3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08H75RTZ8	2	2022-10-31T00:00:00.000Z

71	B08H75RTZ8	R3RPEV2QA8EH8F	I'm really disappointed with this.	I just want to start by saying I do not own a 4k TV, and I would not buy this console unless you own a 4k TV. I dont know how much better the picture quality will be on a 4k TV, I would hope much much better but I think its garbage and a waste of money. With that said I do have a really nice flat screen TV, and the picture quality absolutely sucks. I mean complete garbage. Specially for paying $499.99. Theres not many games for the series X either. I have the game pass and its mostly xbox 360 games. Its like i bought the series x just to play 360 games. Anyways I'm Returning it.	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RPEV2QA8EH8F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08H75RTZ8	1	2022-10-29T00:00:00.000Z

73	B08H75RTZ8	R1S1LRAOSGYSJQ	Works quite well but...	The console works quite well, but it does not state that you must install games on the internal storage in order to play the Series X compatible games. If installed on an external hard drive or the new storage devices only for Series X, they are specifically for storage only. In order to play an installed game, you must move it into the internal hard drive. Another thing is you must give the console physical space, otherwise, it will overheat quite easily.	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1S1LRAOSGYSJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08H75RTZ8	4	2022-10-28T00:00:00.000Z

76	B08H75RTZ8	R2FOFVUTEVGK22	Learning Will Happen	I bought this XBOX Series X specifically because GTA Online was heavily promoting a major upgrade and bonus materials only on the XBOX Series X and PS5 platforms. I figured i needed a upgrade anyway. HOWEVER, what no one is saying is that my current GTA account will not cross over to XBOX, so I would have to start over with a whole new GTA online account. Disappointment.  Also, make sure when purchasing controllers you review the list of games your new controller will work with. The G920 from Logitech for example does not work with every game and does not show up in the XBOX APP's.	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FOFVUTEVGK22/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08H75RTZ8	3	2022-10-28T00:00:00.000Z
77	B08H75RTZ8	RNHNOND9FWRI4	Great Console	Couldn't ask for more. Loads pretty fast, graphics are great. I can load multiple games at once, at least 3 according to my experience. The controller is comfortable, you can play for hours without hurting your fingers. Just waiting for the next upcoming games to continue enjoying my new xbox	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNHNOND9FWRI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08H75RTZ8	5	2022-10-27T00:00:00.000Z
78	B08H75RTZ8	R2IMPRQWYE1L3L	Worth the upgrade from previous gen	Before purchasing this Xbox, I was rocking with an old Xbox One S that I had owned for a couple of years and boy do I regret holding off from buying the series X for so long!  The graphics and processing power is a night and day difference compared to my old Xbox One S. My only regret is not purchasing this a lot sooner than I did.	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IMPRQWYE1L3L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08H75RTZ8	5	2022-10-27T00:00:00.000Z
79	B08H75RTZ8	R117A82FHRDBAR	This is a rippoff	This is not an Xbox X. This is a Xbox S for the same price as one that only has the console and nothing else. Do not buy this product	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R117A82FHRDBAR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08H75RTZ8	1	2022-10-26T00:00:00.000Z

81	B08H75RTZ8	R2CN5NLOPIEI0A	La mas potente del mundo	No es de extrañar que la XBOX SERIES X sea la consola más potente del mundo, pero esto lo compruebas al jugarlo, Xbox realmente ha diseñado una consola capaz de jugar varios juegos al mismo tiempo y en un buen tv se nota la fluidez y la resolución en los juegos.  Una de las mejores compras que he realizado en amazon	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CN5NLOPIEI0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08H75RTZ8	5	2022-10-26T00:00:00.000Z

83	B08H75RTZ8	RSMA6ZM7WY8G4	Slightly better than the Xbox One X…	It’s sleek and I like the design. Fits well on the desk. Nice form factor. If you are looking for next gen this is worth it but if you have an Xbox One X or Scorpio edition from previous gen, I’d hold out till they come out with a pro or plus model. Another $500 for now would not be worth the performance increase in my opinion.	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSMA6ZM7WY8G4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08H75RTZ8	5	2022-10-25T00:00:00.000Z

85	B08H75RTZ8	R8QILK1KUQUIW	Picture quality and memory/storage space	I just got the Xbox Series X. I gave it 4 stars because I really liked my xbox one kinect. It came with voice command and of course the camera you could use to interact with games. I didn't grow up playing video games, I got hooked in my early 20s. I am an old lady of 61 so I've played on a lot of platforms/systems. So the new games are moving on and to keep up I have to buy the newer game systems. And I have to say on this xbox series x I LOVE THE PICTURE/GRAPHICS QUALITY, LOVE THE MEMORY/STORAGE SPACE. It deserves 5 stars but change is hard and money's tight.	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8QILK1KUQUIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08H75RTZ8	4	2022-10-25T00:00:00.000Z
86	B08H75RTZ8	R2JR35U16QSX03	so glad Amazon had this!	First of all, kudos to Amazon for doing this as an invite only. This is a very good way of getting rid of the resellers and scalpers! I hope Amazon starts doing this with other high demand items as well.  I got this during the October 17, 2022 invite. In less than 5 days I had this in my hands. Xbox was shipped in a larger outer box, BUT...........there was no padding or protection! Luckily, box arrived unscathed.  Set-up is like any other Xbox. This one replaced my old Xbox One. As soon as I hooked it all up, I downloaded the new Modern Warfare 2 game. I left the Xbox on overnight and by next morning I was all set to play. Everything ran as expected! No problems whatsoever with the set-up and gaming experience. All-in-all, I am very happy and fortunate to be able to get this, esp. since everyone else is out of stock. Thank you very much Amazon!!	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JR35U16QSX03/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08H75RTZ8	5	2022-10-25T00:00:00.000Z
87	B08H75RTZ8	RL4VXKT2P776L	Amazing	Having a Series X with gamepass is a magical experience. Having access to so many good games at amazing quality including many upgraded older titles. Combined with quick resume I'm able to jugle between a handful of titles at a time seamlessly. Easily the best console I've had and I've been gaming since the NES.	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RL4VXKT2P776L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08H75RTZ8	5	2022-10-25T00:00:00.000Z

91	B07VGRJDFY	R179TJVSJR5J6	Great System	I've been wanting a switch for a long time, but the times wouldn't let me. I finally was able to one and I can not put it down! The pastel colors of the joy cons are just something I enjoy visually. Not only that, I can mix and match my joy cons to make different colour combinations. it's easy to carry around. Even if you don't have money to purchase games there are a plethora of games you can play for free. The switch itself is about 5 to 6 inches. It looks like an ordinary tablet. It's been about a year since I purchased it and I do not regret it.	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R179TJVSJR5J6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07VGRJDFY	5	2022-10-31T00:00:00.000Z

98	B07VGRJDFY	R22IIMTWDJG7BK	Really lives up to the hype.	I couldn't afford to purchase this video game system for a good few years since money was tight while I was attending college. But, after saving up over the course of a few months, I became the proud owner of a Nintendo Switch system last year. And I gotta say... it really lives up to the hype.  Being able to switch (no pun intended) between gaming on the TV and gaming in portable handheld mode has been a very nice, convenient gaming experience indeed. For example, it lets me take the game with me if I suddenly need to head into town with my family and I don't want to wait until I come back from town to continue my game. The games run very well and it gets great internet reception too (most of the time).  I'm not sure I've ever had this much fun playing video games since Pokémon Ultra Moon on the 3DS. I'm definitely glad I ordered this game system. Very satisfied.	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22IIMTWDJG7BK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07VGRJDFY	5	2022-10-25T00:00:00.000Z

108	B07VGRJDFY	R37KW89ITNJJNL	Animal Crossing Fan	As a long time fan of Animal Crossing, I was super excited to get this themed Switch as a gift from a friend. The controllers sometimes don’t like to charge properly like the regular Switch, but overall, I haven’t had nearly as many issues with it as my mom has with her regular one. 10/10	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37KW89ITNJJNL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07VGRJDFY	5	2022-10-21T00:00:00.000Z
109	B07VGRJDFY	R395452HGHYLAW	Great Console, Wrong Country	I've been wanting a switch for a while, and finally ordered one. When I got it, the language on the box and instructions were not in English (assuming it's Japanese) and the power cord was for UK outlets. I live in the US and had to purchase a new power cord (about $15 USD). Other than that, very pleased with the product.	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R395452HGHYLAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07VGRJDFY	4	2022-10-21T00:00:00.000Z

111	B07VGRJDFY	R1FJGRKV4DYHML	It's a switch!	It's an amazing gift for kids, teens, and adults everyone loves the switch. However the joycons are small and don't fit bigger hands, as well as they develop drift after a while. If you do purchase a switch i'd recommend getting a storage upgrade, switch controller, and screen protector.	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FJGRKV4DYHML/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07VGRJDFY	4	2022-10-20T00:00:00.000Z
112	B07VGRJDFY	R217Y1W55HOFTR	NINTENDO SWITCH	Once you buy the gadget( Nitendo switch), you have to keep on buying the games which becomes more expensive.

116	B07VGRJDFY	RETBVLICK8RZY	I waited for this moment	Wait several months, I think years, for the Nintendo Switch to be at retail price ($299), the product arrived completely new and with the box with all the integrity.

117	B07VGRJDFY	R14XFICPZF4STF	Fun for all	We love our Nintendo Switch. With winter on its way I know we will love it even more. My family lives a few hours away so its fun to be able to play games with them from afar. My husband and nephew were even able to play it together on a road trip we went on. It helped pass the time.	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14XFICPZF4STF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07VGRJDFY	5	2022-10-14T00:00:00.000Z

119	B07VGRJDFY	RPLY4TWSELRZ6	DO NOT BUY	I wish I was able to come up with a headline so everyone would read this...We bought my son this switch that connects to the console, after having it for maybe 6mo the joy-con controllers become very loose and wiggly when attached to the switch, eventually they stopped connecting and he was not able to use. So we replaced them, $80 it cost for a pair. It's been two years since we bought it now and we have replace the controllers 3 times. Clearly there is an issue with them. DO NOT BUY the switch with detachable joy-con controllers!	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPLY4TWSELRZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07VGRJDFY	1	2022-10-13T00:00:00.000Z
